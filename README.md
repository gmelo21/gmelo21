# Hi there, I'm Melo!

I'm a developer always looking to get things right. Whether it's working on projects, learning new technologies, or solving problems, I stay determined to succeed at what I do. 
I'm 18yo and currently studying Software Engineering at FIAP, in São Paulo.

## - About Me:

-  Currently diving into **Java**, **Data science and Database design**, and **Excel**.
-  Experienced in **Python**, **JavaScript**, **C++** and **Web Development**.
-  It's not all about work! I also play piano, draw, and game (a lot) when I’m off the clock.
